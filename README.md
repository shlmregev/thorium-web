# Thorium Web

Thorium Web is a web-based reader for EPUB and other digital publications, built using Next.js and modern web technologies. It is designed to provide a fast, responsive, and accessible reading experience.

## Features

- Supports EPUB
- Fast and responsive rendering of publications using Next.js
- Accessible design for readers with disabilities
- Customizable reading experience with themes, adjustable font sizes, line heights, word- and letter-spacing, etc.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to get started with Thorium Web:

- Using the Next.JS App as is
- Using the Thorium Web package in your own project

You can take a look at the [Implementers’ Guide](./docs/ImplementersGuide.md) for more details.

### Using the Next.JS App as is

To get started with Thorium Web, follow these steps:

- Fork or clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-web.git`
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
- Open the reader in your web browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The development server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the code.

### Reading Local EPUB Files

To read an EPUB file on your local disk in the Thorium Web application:

1. In a terminal, use the provided script to start a local server for your EPUB file:
   ```bash
   pnpm run serve-local path/to/your/book.epub
   ```
2. The script will output a URL for Thorium Web (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/read/manifest/...`).
3. Make sure the Next.js development server is running (`pnpm dev` in a separate terminal) and navigate to the printed URL in your browser.

> Note: Make sure to start the Next.js development server with `MANIFEST_ROUTE_FORCE_ENABLE=true` if using the production build, or simply run `pnpm dev` which enables the manifest route by default.

### Using the Thorium Web package in your own project

To use Thorium Web in your own project, install the package and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @edrlab/thorium-web @readium/css @readium/navigator @readium/navigator-html-injectables @readium/shared react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit i18next i18next-browser-languagedetector i18next-http-backend motion react-aria react-aria-components react-stately react-modal-sheet react-resizable-panels 
```

Then you can import and use the components in your own code:

```tsx
import { StatefulReader } from "@edrlab/thorium-web/epub"

const MyApp = () => {
  // ... fetch the manifest and get its self link href
  return (
    <StatefulReader
      rawManifest={ manifestObject }
      selfHref={ manifestSelfHref }
    />
  )
}
```

You can use the StatefulReader component to use the same exact Reader component as the one in the Next.JS App, but with your own [plugins, store and preferences](./docs/packages/Epub/Guide.md). Or you can use its components to build your own custom reader.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At this point in time, when using components from `@edrlab/thorium-web/epub`, you have to import the store/lib, hooks and Preferences Provider from the same path, otherwise your custom app will use another instance.

## Customizing

You can customize this project extensively through [Preferences](./src/preferences.ts): breakpoints, which and how to display actions, themes provided to users, configuration of the docking system, sizes and offsets of icons, etc.

See [Customization in docs](./docs/customization/Customization.md) for further details.

## Building and Deploying

To build and deploy Thorium Web, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm run deploy
```

This will create a production-ready build of the reader and deploy it to the specified hosting platform.

This repository is using the following configuration:

- Go-Toolkit on Google Cloud Run
- Thorium Web App on CloudFlare Pages
- Assets e.g. demo EPUBs stored on Google Cloud Storage

To deploy, the following script is run: 

```bash
npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages && npx wrangler pages deploy
```

It’s running with defaults, which means a commit triggers a build and deploy for the current branch to preview. You can then access the app from a subdomain using this branch name. 

More details in [the @cloudflare/next-on-pages repo](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages).

## Known Issues

- Fullscreen is not available on iOS and very limited on iPadOS. We encountered so many issues on iPadOS that it has been disabled for the time being.
- on iPadOS, when the app is requested in its desktop version, some interventions are implemented in Safari to provide users with a “desktop-class experience.” Unfortunately, one of this intervention is impacting the font-size setting, and requires a flag to be toggled in the Preferences API in order to apply a patch. However, this patch may not catch all edge cases.
